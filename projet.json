            "details" : "This project involved designing three distinct shaders in Unlit mode. Water Shader, Simulation of water movement and reflections, with the integration of a wave effect to represent dynamic waves. Terrain Generation Shader, Creation of dynamic landscapes from a plane. Cloud Shader, Design of volumetric clouds to enhance the visual atmosphere. Additionally, a day-night cycle system was integrated to improve immersion by adjusting the lighting based on time. As a bonus, I experimented with creating a fog shader, adding an extra layer to the project's atmosphere.",

            "details": "In the project I focused on designing and implementing various systems to create a compelling horror game atmosphere. Music and Lighting System: I developed a dynami, system to synchronize eerie soundscapes with responsive lighting, enhancing the tension and mood.Camera Post-Processing, I implemented advanced post-processing effects, including grain, color grading, and distortion, to emphasize the unsettling horror aesthetic. Immersive Enhancements, As an additional challenge, I experimented with environmental effects like fog and shadow animations to further immerse players in the eerie setting.",

Procedural terrain generation, Designing a dynamic environment that is randomly generated each match. Kicking mechanics Setting up an interaction to kick the ball randomly. Visual effects Adding a trail effect behind the ball and players to enhance immersion. Animations: Creating and integrating animations, particularly for scoring a goal. User Interface (UI): Exploring and integrating my first user interface in a game. ",

I also designed a dynamic user interface that adapts based on the player's view direction, a system for displaying and adding text, and an inventory where objects can be stored and retrieved. Lastly, I created a magical inventory that, when opened, randomly generates shelves and objects. ",

I designed a knock-down game where the player has four attempts to knock over all the cans, a bumper car system where they must remove all the cars as quickly as possible before exiting, and a small roller coaster to enhance the experience. I also used a NavMesh to animate NPCs that react to the playerâ€™s presence by greeting them. Among them, a monster lurks and, if the player gets too close, it starts chasing and attacking them.",
